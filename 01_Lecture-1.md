# Cybersecurity Notes

## 🔐 CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Ensures that only authorized users can access data.  
  - Methods: authentication, encryption, access controls.  
- **Integrity** – Ensures data is accurate and unaltered.  
  - Methods: checksums, hashing, digital signatures.  
- **Availability** – Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed.  
  - Methods: redundancy, backups, disaster recovery, uptime monitoring.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts

### Processes
- Supply chain connections  
- Business workflows that rely on secure IT systems  

### Systems
- Data collection mechanisms  
- Information flow pipelines (databases, storage, analytics platforms)  

### Technology
- IT systems, networks, and communication infrastructure  

### Facility Assets
- Physical resources such as buildings, land, vehicles, and machinery

## ⚠️ Security Terms

- **Vulnerability** – A weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited.  
- **Threat** – When an attacker has the capability and opportunity to exploit a vulnerability.  
- **Risk** – The probable frequency and magnitude of loss resulting from a threat exploiting a vulnerability.  

---

## 🚨 Threat Examples

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** – Discovered in 2016; attackers used malicious DM deeplinks to insert malware.  
- **Social Engineering (Twitter Hack, 2020)** – Attackers phished employees, gained admin access, and compromised accounts like Joe Biden and Barack Obama.  
- **Spam** – High probability, low loss risk.  
- **Account Takeover** – Lower probability but higher loss risk.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Threat Actors

- **Nation-State Actor** – Government-sponsored hacking groups.  
- **Hacktivist** – Promote political or social change through cyberattacks.  
- **Cybercriminal** – Commit crimes for financial gain (fraud, ransomware, theft).  
- **Insiders** – Employees or individuals within an organization who abuse access.

## 🛡️ Controls

Controls are policies, procedures, or actions designed to **mitigate risk**.  

- **Preventive Controls** – Stop an incident before it occurs.  
  - Examples: firewalls, multi-factor authentication, encryption.  

- **Detective Controls** – Identify incidents as they occur.  
  - Examples: intrusion detection systems, honeypots, log monitoring.  

- **Corrective Controls** – Restore systems after an incident.  
  - Examples: patch management, backups, incident response plans.  

- **Physical Controls** – Restrict access to physical environments.  
  - Examples: locks, guards, cameras, keycards.  

- **Technical Controls** – Use technology to enforce security.  
  - Examples: antivirus software, intrusion prevention systems, honeypots.  

- **Administrative Controls** – Policies, training, and procedures that guide user behavior.  
  - Examples: security awareness training, access review policies, incident response guidelines.  

**Example:**  
Honeypots (technical, detective) are deployed to **attract attackers**, allowing monitoring and detection of malicious activity.

## 📑 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The NIST CSF provides a structured way to **assess and mitigate risk**.  
It includes five core functions:  

1. **Identify** – Understand organizational systems, assets, and risks.  
2. **Protect** – Develop safeguards to secure assets and reduce risk.  
3. **Detect** – Identify security events and anomalies quickly.  
4. **Respond** – Contain and mitigate the impact of an incident.  
5. **Recover** – Restore systems, services, and operations after an incident.

# ✅ Summary

- The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of cybersecurity.  
- Security requires addressing **processes, systems, technology, and facilities**.  
- Risks arise when **threats exploit vulnerabilities**, causing potential loss.  
- **Threat actors** can be external (nation-states, hacktivists, criminals) or internal (insiders).  
- **Controls** mitigate risks through preventive, detective, corrective, physical, technical, and administrative methods.  
- The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** provides a cycle to manage risks effectively.
